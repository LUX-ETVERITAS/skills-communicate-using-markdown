GitHub Actions went ahead and made a branch for you. So you'll need to add to the file we've created in the branch, and we will check your work as you work through this course!

    Return to your pull request.

    Use Markdown to create a task list. Here is an example:

    - [ ] Turn on GitHub Pages
    - [ ] Outline my portfolio
    - [ ] Introduce myself to the world

Remember, a task list starts with the syntax - [ ] and then the task list item. The formatting is specific!

Use the Preview tab to check your Markdown formatting.

Commit the changes to the file.

Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). GitHub Actions will automatically update to the next step.
